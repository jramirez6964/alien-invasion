In *Alien Invasion*, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the 
bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using 
the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a 
fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player 
shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroyes all the aliens, a new 
fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the 
player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If 
the player loses three ships, the game ends.

For the first development phase, we'll make a ship that can move right and left 
when the player presses the arrow keys and fire bullets when the player presses 
the spacebar.

Reviewing the project in Chapter 13: Aliens!
We want to:
* Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen, with
  appropriate spacing around it.
* Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit
  horizontally. Then we'll create additional rows of aliens until we have a full
  fleet.
* Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, an
  alien hits the ship, or an alien touches the ground. If the entire fleet is
  shot down, we'll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the ship or the ground,
  we'll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.
* Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player
  has used up the allotted number of ships.
